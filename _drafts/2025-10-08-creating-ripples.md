Around a month ago, I returned from a weekend away with the Re-Action Collective. It's taken me some time to reflect on the time and to process some things (and I've also procrastinated writing this), but I wanted to share some of my reflections here.

# Be more childlike
During the Re-Action Actionism weekend, it was mainly a group of adults, myself being one of the youngest amongst them. However, some of them also brought their children along, which was great! I've touched on how we can learn so much from children in the past when reflecting on my time in Portugal at the start of the year, and I'm about to do so again. 

I often think about how we should be more childlike in many aspects of our lives. You see, children are often highly mobile - not through hours of mobility exercises, but simply because they move around a lot and get their bodies into lots of different positions. I always try to remind myself that this is something that needn't be lost as we grow older and that all that's required is to regularly move the body in different ways. Children aren't complaining about bad backs, stiff necks, and sore knees, because they're moving them in the way they're designed - not being sedentary all of the time. I noticed just how easy it was for the children who were there to move fluidly, without effort - be it doing cartwheels or kneeling on the floor. 

As well as reminding me of my increasing lack of mobility, one of the children essentially spent all weekend barefoot. Now, some might say that this is 'unsafe', however, we were staying on a private piece of land with lots of fields and forest paths, so there was nothing that we might find walking along the pavement underfoot. I felt inspired to be barefoot as much as I could over the weekend too, and even went on a barefoot run to the river before going for a cold dip. I still believe that we're designed to walk and run without shoes (at least on natural terrain, anyway) and it felt so incredibly freeing and nice to be running with my feet touching the dirt. I paid more attention to my foot placement and ran with a higher cadence, reminding me what my natural running form is. However, my feet were nowhere near as conditioned as a couple of the others, one of them being a child, who's feet were far tougher and used to being barefoot than mine. It inspired me to spend more time barefoot after the weekend and to try to build my feet back up to what they're made to do. 

Moving on, I was also struck and energised by how curious the children there were, and also how emotionally intelligent they were. You see, I think that we have a tendency not to allow children to freely express their views on topics that we perhaps assume that they know nothing about, but I think that they're often far more clued up than we think. One child came over to me when I was sat next to my tent and started pointing out the different mushrooms that were growing wild in the grass. It made me appreciate the level of presence that children have, before they're attention starts to be taken away from them by technology later on in their lives. All of the children took part in the team-based activities that we did, one of them being an activity where we used lego to build a representation of the future that we wanted to see. Even at a young age, it was touching to see their lego structures and to hear their words about the future that they'd like to see. It struck a cord inside me as everything that they built and said are things that we all want to see, however, we've somehow got lost in our way as we've grown older and have gone off pieste...

The children's curiosity, energy, and enthusiasm for the simple things in life reminded me that we should be more childlike in some parts of our lives. 

# We are nature 
- Forest bathing experience 
- Barefoot running and swimming in the river 
- Being in tune with our senses - there are more than 5, supposedly 
- OK, there was some noise, but the mind is powerful and things like this don't have to bother us if we don't want them too
- But...I did see some irony here that there was an organic farm and a nature reserve and lots of music and dirt bikes making noise
- Also realised how dry the airtifical reservoir was - maybe it's not due to warmer summer, but it reminded me that climate change does cause things like this and that it is real

# Food from farm to fork
- Grown on the farm 
- The veg looked markedly different - the plum tomatoes etc.
- Tried different things that were in season 
- Amazing people pulled the ingredients together to make delicious, nutritious food - it's not hard when you have good ingredients 
- Showing what's possible and that a different way is doable

# Creating, not consuming 
- Embroidery, painting, etc.
- Spent little time on my phone - no signal, no problem - just being present 
The importance of good storytelling:
- Discussed why the right wing have been so effective in a sense - have to learn from them in terms of good storytelling 
- Maybe try to find the framework? 

# Actioning in the future
- Collective action - key
- Like bees in a hive bouncing loads of ideas off each other - inspiring to be around people who are brave and are pursung what they love and care about 
- Keep chipping away at your 'passion projects'
- The importance of connecting with nature 
- Shared my ideas about a potential project and went down well - good to have people who beleive in what you are doing and where you are heading
