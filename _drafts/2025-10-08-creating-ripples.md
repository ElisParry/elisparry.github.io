A couple of weeks ago now, I returned from a weekend away with the Re-Action Collective. It's taken me some time to reflect on the time and to process some things, but I wanted to share some of my reflections here.

- Explain what I am going to take with me to the future - things I plan to do etc. 

# Be more childlike
- Children were there too
- Being barefoot, moving around fluidly without complaining of bad backs etc. 
- Asking questions - engaging in thoughtful, long discussions - maybe it's because at this age they haven't been victims to the attention economy yet? 
- Being curious
- Full of energy 

# We are nature 
- Forest bathing experience 
- Barefoot running and swimming in the river 
- Being in tune with our senses - there are more than 5, supposedly 
- OK, there was some noise, but the mind is powerful and things like this don't have to bother us if we don't want them too
- But...I did see some irony here that there was an organic farm and a nature reserve and lots of music and dirt bikes making noise
- Also realised how dry the airtifical reservoir was - maybe it's not due to warmer summer, but it reminded me that climate change does cause things like this and that it is real

# Food from farm to fork
- Grown on the farm 
- The veg looked markedly different - the plum tomatoes etc.
- Tried different things that were in season 
- Amazing people pulled the ingredients together to make delicious, nutritious food - it's not hard when you have good ingredients 
- Showing what's possible and that a different way is doable

# Creating, not consuming 
- Embroidery, painting, etc.
- Spent little time on my phone - no signal, no problem - just being present 
The importance of good storytelling:
- Discussed why the right wing have been so effective in a sense - have to learn from them in terms of good storytelling 
- Maybe try to find the framework? 

# Actioning in the future
- Collective action - key
- Like bees in a hive bouncing loads of ideas off each other - inspiring to be around people who are brave and are pursung what they love and care about 
- Keep chipping away at your 'passion projects'
- The importance of connecting with nature 
- Shared my ideas about a potential project and went down well - good to have people who beleive in what you are doing and where you are heading
