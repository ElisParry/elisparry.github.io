I'm Elis, and I have an interest in climate change and the generation of clean energy and, therefore, I'm currently pursuing a care​er in a related field. 

My philosophy is to do what you love. So when I'm not doing physics, I like to spend the rest of my time doing the other things I love. These include doing sports, volunteering and spending time with my friends and family, including my dog, Pero. I created this page to share some of these interests. Hopefully, it will give you a good idea of some of the things I get up to!

I hope you enjoy.
