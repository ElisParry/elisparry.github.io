I'm Elis, and I have an interest in climate change and, therefore, I'm hoping to pursue a career at the intersection of climate science and policy.

My philosophy is to do what you love. So when I'm not doing physics, I like to spend the rest of my time doing the other things I love. These include doing sports, volunteering and spending time with my friends and family, including my dog, Pero. I created this page to share some of these interests. Hopefully, it will give you a good idea of some of the things I get up to!

I hope you enjoy.

Also, I have no presence on any social media platforms other than my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdtGRk6_Y2FJZs0nkr-XR0w).
