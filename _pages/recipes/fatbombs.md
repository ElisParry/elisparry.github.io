  This is the original recipe for my long run fat bombs. Having realised the importance of taking on some healthy fats and a little bit of protein during a long run, I went about messing around with different ingredients to make some tasty fatbombs that didn't fall apart in my beeswax wraps. I tested these out during my training runs for the Cambridge to Oxford ultramarathon, where I ate at least 15 of them to fuel me over 14 hours. Since then, they've been my trusted go to when it comes to a fuel source that's packed full of good stuff. The added fats and proteins helps reduce the blood sugar spike you have mid-run, giving you more sustained energy to enjoy your long runs.

ingredients: |
  - 1 tin of chickpeas
  - 20 dates
  - 3 tbsp nut butter
  - 1 cup ground almonds
  - 1/2 cup honey
  - 1/8 cup olive oil
  - 2 cups oats

method: |
  1. Blitz half of the oats (1 cup) in the blender to make and oat flour and then place in a bowl to one side.
  2. Add everything apart from the oats to a blender and blitz until well combined (adding the liquids last can help get it blending).
  3. In a large mixing bowl, add the blended mixture to the bowl with the oat flour and the rest of the oats.
  4. Add more oats if too wet or more honey if too try.
  5. Place in the fridge for 30 minutes to cool.
  6. Form bite-sized balls with the mixture and store them in an air-tight container in the fridge. 

use: |
  Wrap them in some beeswax wrap and eat one every 30 minutes or so. I like alternating them with bananas - one banana on the half-hour mark, one fatbomb on the hour mark. I've won races using these. They're seriously good!
