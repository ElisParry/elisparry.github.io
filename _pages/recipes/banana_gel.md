  This is my take on a homemade energy gel. I've not used energy gels since my first ultra back in 2021. They're expensive, full of strange ingredients, and create a whole load of waste from their packaging. I needed something a bit lighter and more compact than my usual bananas for a 5 hr recce on the Anglesey Coastal Path, so decided to just blitz as many bananas as possible in a blender and add a couple of extras to make an energy gel.

ingredients: |
  - 8 medium ripe bananas 
  - 2 tbsp honey
  - 2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
  - Salt

method: |
  1. Add everything to a blender and blitz into a puree. 
  2. Add salt based off your required intake (this will vary depending on how much you sweat).
  3. Pour into a soft flask or two and store in the fridge until your run. 

  Note: it should just about fit in one 500 ml soft flask unless your bananas are giant.

use: |
  This is a seriously punchy gel. 8 bananas gives you around 8 x 27 = 216 g of carbs, plus an extra 35 g from the honey and around 28 g of fat from the olive oil. That's close to 250 g of carbs and 28 g of fat - good enough for a long long run. I reckon at least 5 hours, but I'll have to test that claim!
