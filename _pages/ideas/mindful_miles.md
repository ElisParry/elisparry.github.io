The next thing I'd like to propose is the concept of Mindful Miles. The name isn't too inventive, I know, but it somewhat flows off the tounge again! 

Unlike Watch Free Wednesday, Mindful Miles is a broader idea that I'd like to share with others for them to try. It will also very much be something that will evolve and change over time as I learn more about mindfulness and its relation to running. However, I do have an initial idea that I think would help me and others to find joy in their running.  

 

Many people have heard about journalling and are aware of the benefits of this practice. I've been journalling every day now for nearly two years and I can really vouch for it. One of the main reasons I like journalling is that it allows me to reflect on things. Since I believe in the power of having a regular reflective practice, I wanted to think of a way of incorporating a similar practice with running. It's been shown that if we tie two habits together - known as habit stacking - then it's easier to keep up these good habits. So, my idea is for Mindful Miles to be a 'practice' that runners at least try, and ideally consistently do. It might sound cumbersome and tedious, but I think that it will pay dividends in the long run (no pun intended). Here's the initial concept:  

 

1. **Pre-run**: Before heading out of the door, maybe just after lacing up your shoes, take a few deep breaths (inhale, hold, and exhale for 4 second each, 5 to 10 times) with your eyes shut and think about *why you run*.  
2. **During run**: Pay attention to how you feel, to your breath, to your rhythm, and to your surroundings. Pay attention to your senses. What do you *see*, *hear*, *feel*, *smell*, and *taste*? Take moments to pause and take in your surroundings and to listen to your heart working and your breath deepening. 
3. **Post-run**: Take time to transition out of your run. Do some light movement, maybe even some stretches to loosen up. Importantly, take time to *reflect* on your run. Recollect how you felt during the run. Write down what you saw, felt, heard, smelt, and tasted. Reflect on how your *mind* and your *body* felt. Was your mind busy and full of thoughts? Or was it calm and at peace? Write freely, without judgement. 

 

This is the general idea of Mindful Miles and the guidance I wanted to give to anyone wanting to try it. Taking deep breaths before the run helps to regulate our nervous system and thinking about why you run will help remind you of why you want to get out of the door. Tuning in with our body and with nature allows us to feel more connected to these two things, thereby finding more joy in our running. And, finally, reflecting on how we felt and what we were grateful about during our run allows us to cultivate a sense of gratitude and incorporate some mindfulness into our lives. The hope is that by listening to how our bodies feel when we're running, we can run more sustainably in the long run and, ultimately, find more joy in our running.
