Having been passionate about increasing accessibility to the outdoors and reducing the waste generated by the running industry, I came across Re-Action Collective - a collective of people and organisations who are re-imagining the outdoors and trying to create a more accessible, circular, and community-based outdoor industry. After discussing how I could use my running to help spread their message, they agreed to form a partnership with me as of February 2025. What's even cooler is that Preloved Sports - a member of Re-Action Collective working to create a sustainable model that uses preloved sportswear to provide inspiration, opportunities, and support to others - will also be supporting me. 

My mission is to inspire and support others to chase their dreams whilst respecting the world that we live in. I'm incredibly grateful to Re-Action and Preloved Sports for helping me to do this. There is no monetary transaction involved here, simply collaboration and community action to help mobilise change.

> “A running community making changes for a fitter planet”

By being part of the Green Runners, I aim to educate myself and others about climate change as well as the effect that the sport of running is having on our planet to make running a greener community. When racing, and even when running around my local area, I try to spread The Green Runners' message and proudly wear my badge.

We're running out of time. Join The Green Runners [now](https://thegreenrunners.com/become-a-member/).
