Does anyone else think that the word 'recipes' looks strange? Anyway, here is a page where I share some of the recipes for my long run snacks, as well as some recipes for meals outside of your running. Having gone around the block with different diets and ways of eating, I've realised that eating healthy and well is simple at its core. 

Avoid junk food - things such as refined carbohydrates and ultraprocessed foods - and cook with whole, simple ingredients. 

The truth is, however, that unless we know how to bring a bunch of whole ingredients together, then we can end up with something highly unappetising and boring. Here is me playing my small part in giving people some inspiration for some no-junk running recipes.
